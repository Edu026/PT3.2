Googling yields information like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372&quot;&gt;this Mayo Clinic article&lt;/a&gt; that mixes serving sizes and brewing methods, and it reports one 8 oz coffee contains &quot;95-200 mg&quot; of caffeine, which is a huge range. If I have three cups of coffee in a day, is that 300 or 600 mg of caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are so many variables in prepared coffee, different extraction methods, beans, roasts, serving sizes, mixed with different amounts of water or milk. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a general method for calculating the caffeine in prepared coffee?&lt;/strong&gt; Something like &quot;most brewing methods extract &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; mg of caffeine from each &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; grams of ground coffee&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or more specifically, what method would I use to accurately estimate how much caffeine is in an 8oz serving from my 10 oz french press, made with medium- (not course-) ground medium-roast arabica beans, brewed 4 minutes before decanting?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="86" LastActivityDate="2022-11-24T16:18:35.037" Title="How can I figure out how much caffeine is in my cup?"
